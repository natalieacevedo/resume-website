Hello there!. I am Natalie, a passionate web developer who started her training as a web-developer two years ago through free resources online; and then, 
by completing a 700 hours bootcamp. I love programming and hope to become the best developer I can possibly be.
This Portafolio showcasts the various projects and activities I have completed, there going to be many more to come. 
I truly believe that learning never stops. Thanks for stopping by :)
